This test is designed to test your basic programming skills and machine learning/mathematics knowledge using pytorch.\n","2. You can use any material to finish the test (book, internet, etc.). However, please keep this test to you only during and after the test. You are not allowed to share the test/communicate with others to get help during the test.\n","3. You will obtain partial credits if you show a clear thought process even if you don't get the final answer correctly.\n","4. Please follow good programming practices and make your code easily readable (e.g. variable naming, documentation, comments etc.), following PEP8 is a plus.\n","5. Make sure your code is runnable after running the set-up commands. The reviewer is not responsible for installing missing libraries you forget to include.\n","6. Please read the instructions for each question carefully, especially what is & isn't allowed. If you don't follow the instructions, you won't receive any credit for that question.\n","7. Most likely, you cannot answer all the questions. If you can score 40\\% +, you can proceed to the next round.\n","8. If certain conditions of the questions (for eg. hyperparameter values) are not stated, you are free to choose any values you want.\n","9. Please start your code right below the `# YOUR CODE STARTS HERE` line. If there is a `# YOUR CODE ENDS HERE` line, please put your implementation between `# YOUR CODE STARTS HERE` and `# YOUR CODE ENDS HERE`. \n","10. Last but not least, please manage your time as you have 2 hours to finish the test. You will have another 5 minutes to send your implementation to us (i.e., you have 2 hours and 5 minutes in total). We have already implemented the timestamp printing line to track your output timestamp for every question. You will receive 0 credit for any question which:\n","    - you remove our timestamp tracking line\n","    - no timestamp printed out in the output\n","    - you exceed your limit time for the test\n","\n","*One good news to motivate you before the test: You don't need to have a GPU machine to finish the test, only CPU should help.*\n","\n","**Please try your best.
